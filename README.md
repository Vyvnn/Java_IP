##  Caesar cipher  with Java
This project is about Caesar Cipher Using Java Program
By Vivian Muthoni

##  Description
-   Julius Caesar was the first one who used it for communicating with his officials. Based on his name, this technique was named as Caesar Cipher technique. An integer value is required to cipher a given text. The integer value is known as shift, which indicates the number of positions each letter of the text has been moved down.
-   A Caesar cipher is a type of substitution in which each letter is shifted a certain number of places also known as a key, down the alphabet.  For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.
